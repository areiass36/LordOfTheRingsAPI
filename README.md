# The Lord Of the Rings Reactive API

This is an API I developed for my Java bootcamp.

The propose of this project is to store data about lotr characters, like name, title, birth, death an so on.

It was the first time I ever used Spring Webflux to develop a reactive api and I really dig doing it.

I learned a lot about reactive apis with it, and specially about postgres, which was a database I have never used before in a project.
